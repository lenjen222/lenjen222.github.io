Hello and welcome to the GitHub sanctuary where code and creativity coalesce, somewhere between mild confusion and an Eureka! moment. If you're here, you're probably either lost or genuinely interested in the projects I've been working on. In both cases, welcome!

I'm Len Jensen, and this repository serves as a display case for my coding endeavors. Here you'll find a curated collection of projects, each having its fair share of problem-solving, creativity, and just a dash of wry humor.

What's Inside
This repository is organized into various sections to help you better navigate through the maze of my professional life:

📊 Data Science Projects: Where numbers tell stories and graphs aren't just pretty pictures
🌐 Web Development: Because everyone needs a corner of the internet to call their own
🛠 DevOps and Automation: Ah yes, the art of making machines do the work so we don't have to
📱 Mobile App Development: Pocket-sized miracles
🎲 Miscellaneous: The island of misfit code, because not all projects fit into neat little categories
Structure of Each Project
Each project will include:

README.md: A concise guide about the project, less akin to an Ikea manual and more like that helpful neighbor who actually knows how to fix things
Code Files: The meat of the meal
Assets: Multimedia files and other bells and whistles
Demo: A snapshot or demo to show you the project in its full glory

Should you wish to discuss anything more intricate than the weather or the existential dread of debugging, you can reach out to me at lenjensen222@gmail.com.

Thank you for visiting, and as you traverse this repository, may your build always compile and your coffee cup never empty.

Best regards,

Len Jensen
